          <div class="summary">
            <p> An introduction to the theory behind machine learning, covering 
                topics such as the perceptron algorithm, decision trees, neural
                networks, recommender systems and Markov models. Projects were 
                implemented in Python using the PyTorch library.

          <div class="summary">
            <p> A course teaching how computers function and execute programs.
                This course covered processor design and the compiling/assembly
                process, as well as cache organization and function. Projects
                were designed to simulate how computers used processes such as
                cache, linking, and assembling. Projects were written in C and
                a educational assembly language known as LC2K.

          <div class="summary">
            <p> A course covering everything in the title - specifically 
                focusing on application of algorithms and analyzing time
                complexity. This course covered topics such as BFS, DFS,
                graph theory, and common data structures found in the STL.
                Projects were written in C++.

            <p> An introduction to computing starting from the ground up
                - students learned about logic gates all the way to how
                simple operating systems worked. This was a project based
                course where students created a toy out of a circuit
                board containing a microprocessor.
